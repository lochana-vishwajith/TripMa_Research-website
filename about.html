            <p>The past research on [2] seems to give out the solution for most of the major concerns that we have found
                here although the system does not provide intelligence techniques to learn dynamically as well as the
                system is highly biased on user feedback. Various past research has done different partial
                implementations of different travel planning mechanisms separately although they do not cater to fully
                functional planning systems. The greatest challenge in trip planning systems is the identification of
                problems to achieve. Most travel planning applications cater to security-based transactional and
                accommodation-related concerns. Hence, we have combined the importance of geo-social importance to the
                accommodation through index matrices.
                A small number of past research identified the importance of geo-social importance in trip and travel
                planning. Past research [3] had been done on the intention of traveling effectively through the visiting
                days, though not concerned about the importance of traveling to a selected place along with companion
                mapping and safety and secure based intentions.

            </p>
            <p>
                There are some past research initiatives on tour companion matching including Trip Girraf, Flip the Trip
                and GAFFL. It enables users to locate travel companions using their precise location, along with date
                and time, in addition, a system had been set up to locate travel companions by taking into account the
                traveler's preferences for the mode of transportation, the route they want, and their mobility needs,
                such as the need for escalators, lifts, and stairs [4]. Determine the preferences of the various
                travelers for each factor while choosing the factors for the proposed system. Language abilities,
                budget, age, and mode of transportation have been determined to be the top four variables for moving the
                project forward. When concerning past research on safety and security identifications, many of them have
                done separate analyses on risk hotspot identifications through clustering KNN-based approaches using the
                google Map API (Application Programming Interfaces) routes. [5] [6]. The research past research shows
                the importance of how data exists in the datasets when choosing the correct clustering approach. Most of
                the past research is based on the singular variant of threat identification and is limited to risk
                rating, but Tripma analyzes and predicts the risk category and relevant risk mitigations as well. The
                research paper [7] discusses the importance of user input-based indexes in deriving travel planning. The
                importance of live inputs given by real-time users is shown by [8] although it does not emphasize
                intelligence systems for the prediction. as in past research on NLP-related techniques the
                identification of learning through given data is taken into the consideration according to the tour
                related information recommendations [9].

            <p>
                When deciding when to go, it's important to consider the crowd level, local weather, and overall vibe of
                the destination. Identification of urban crowds using geo-located social media data is discussed in the
                research [10]. It forecasts New York City's crowdedness using information from Twitter. Also included in
                the earlier paper [11] is the spatiotemporal analysis of tourists and locals in Shanghai based on Weibo
                data from location-based social networks. The importance of building trust with the system is a highly
                important factor when it comes to trip planning systems. In the past paper, the effectiveness of the
                online service or product is assessed through a study using a questionnaire-based system [12]. In this
                case, they suggest a sentiment analysis-based automatic evaluation system that would be more flexible
                and useful than the current system. With the use of supervised and semi-supervised machine learning
                algorithms, this suggested system analyzes running text feedback to discover essential characteristics
                and orientations.

            <label class="topicLblProb">Research Problem </label><br />
            <p>As discussed in the previous sections even though there are many different systems and researches has
                implemented trip-planning systems. Some vital characteristics need to be provided to build a complete
                application. Companion matching, security, and safety zone identification along with risk mitigation
                suggestion providers, when and what destination appraisal to visit according to different user
                perspectives as well as the gaining users' trust and reliability towards the system.
                When comes to travel companion mapping concerns There are several existing systems to find travel
                companions online. Most of the existing systems are considered the destination and date range wish to
                travel such as workaway.info, couch surfing, and the web application called JOIN MY TRIP considers the
                activities wish to do by the travelers and the destination. However, when traveling with a companion,
                communication among the members is an important factor to enjoy the trip. However, none of the systems
                do consider the languages that can speak by both the requested traveler and the companion, when
                suggesting a companion. Apart from the language, the budget range of the tour and the age of the
                travelers plays a major role, when traveling with a stranger. Since age is a critical factor for the
                user, several existing systems consider the age of the users. Nevertheless, none of the systems that are
                available in the productions does consider the users within an age range according to the requested
                user’s preference. Apart from that, if the budget of the suggested companions is higher than or lower
                than by a considerable amount, satisfaction with the trip will be decreased. So that some of the systems
                consider the budget when suggesting users but none of the systems consider the users within a range of
                budget according to the given deviation values by the user. Even though, priority for each factor that
                considers when suggesting a travel buddy may differ from one user to another user. Nevertheless, none of
                the available systems does consider the priority for each factor such as the age of the partner,
                language skills, budget, and transportation medium apart from the main factor of distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main intend of the suggested system is to overcome the above problems by considering the age,
                language can speak and budget range of the tour, along with the priority values given for each factor by
                the user, when suggesting a travel companion by the system.
                The main problem that tries to achieve through the safety and security assistant component throughout
                this research is to find a digitalized solution that could calculate the safeness of an area as an
                indication where a user could able to identify according to their priorities. Which places they need to
                be more aware of according to the past issue data and suggestions provided by them to overcome. This
                problem comprised sub-problems of where and how we could derive the safeness of an area and what are the
                potential threats. What and when to inform them along with how to identify potential solutions to the
                identified risks. Also, since this is a business visualize the threats in a manner where the user could
                grab the core content with minimum effort.

            </p>
            <p>
                The main intention of the best time to visit a component in the system is to suggest to users about a
                place. By considering the crowdedness of a place, the weather condition of the place, existing user’s
                feedback on visiting the place, and the place is open before visiting along with the priority values
                given for some factors by the user when suggesting the best time to visit by the system.
                When identification of problems in relevance to the user feedback analyzer, finding out what clients
                want and expect is one of the biggest issues that online business owners face. To provide travelers with
                better service through the web platform, the system administrator in this case must understand their
                wants. There are numerous approaches to comprehending the wants of the customer, but one of the best
                ways is to examine their feedback. [29]
                Before using a service, online users check information on prior customers on platforms dedicated to
                travel planning Information about the various categories of internet service providers can be found on a
                wide range of sites. However, the data's accuracy is in doubt. In most online systems, after we consume
                a product or a service we can give feedback to the system regarding our experience with the product.
                However, the problem is we can add any feedback we want. There is no validity for the feedback. We can
                give a one star to the product and we can say “good product” in the feedback section. However, it does
                not amplify the fact behind the review. Therefore, if we perform a feedback analysis from a data set
                that is not accurate, the accuracy of the results is questionable. From the wrong sentiment analysis
                results, we cannot identify the users' real emotions behind the feedback.

            <label class="topicLblProb">Main Objective</label><br />
            <p>The main objective of the software solution is to build a full -fledged mobile application where a user
                could able to plan their trip with the use of local geo -social knowledge provided by the system.</p>
            <p>
                When it comes to suggesting the best travel companion or a group of companions by identifying the
                requested user’s preferences, priorities for each factor, and travel destination that is selected at the
                trip planning stage of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the help of data collected from the registration form and then the preference profile creation form
                that is saved in the DB, the system will identify the preferences and relevant deviation values that the
                user belongs to. According to the given preferences, priority, and deviations for some factors such as
                age and budget, the system will check the most considerable factor for that age category among the
                budget, age of the companion, and languages that can speak. By considering the most weighted factor and
                other factors respectively for that identified age range, the system will suggest the best travel
                companion or group of companions along with the matching percentage.
            </p>
            <p>
                When considering the safety assistant component the main objective of the software solution is to
                suggest the safeness of a place according to user-defined and predefined schemas with the help of data
                collected from the google API and the user's selection criteria. The system also needs to give us safety
                mitigation using past resources, which are used by tourist guidance. Along with that when a user inputs
                a risk they have faced they will be informed of mitigations and also data will be saved in a data store
                once other users added the destinations they should be informed of the relevant details.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main objective of the proposed software solution is to suggest the best time to visit tourist
                attractions places by identifying the crowdedness, weather conditions, open-close hours, and existing
                user recommendations according to user preference for crowdedness and weather conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The major objective of the user feedback analyzer is to create an automated system to assess visitor
                input and determine their needs to deliver better service. We assess the traveler feedback from this
                system and present the most accurate positive feedback in the system feedback part so that future
                travelers can obtain more accurate information about the online platform as well as the travel
                experience in Sri Lanka. The administrator of the web platform can examine the favorable and unfavorable
                comments made by the tourist's thanks to this automated technique. The administrator should primarily
                concentrate on the unfavorable comments made by users so that he can try to improve the system and
                enhance the application's usability for passengers.
