			<h2>Welcome to TripMa</h2>
			<p class="introP">
				The traveling industry has been one of the primary income sources in Sri Lanka although with the
				rapid incensement of digitalization of the world. People tend to use more digital platforms for
				traveling.
				The basic drawback of classical planning systems such as organizational trip planning or
				package-based trip planning is that they are highly dependent on the organizer’s motivations. The
				classical travel planning methods lack the independent decision-making ability of the user to travel
				and schedule what they need to occupy. Although the classical planning methodologies provide users
				expertise and knowledge of the local geography which provides users with an organized touring
				experience.
				When we consider the existing trip planning web-related products, many systems used different
				booking systems and travel information guides but none of them addresses the need for a quality
				travel experience.
				When considering the gaps existing in modern trip-related products, the inaccurate mate or tour
				group assigning can be seen frequently in addition to those there are many systems, which provide
				travel attraction information but none of them gives an accurate time to visit for a better
				experience. In addition, there are very few systems have considered the importance of local
				security-related information. Systems also tend to miss the importance of publishing the accuracy
				and the user satisfaction rating of the system to enhance the confidence of potential users.
				Throughout this Research paper, we have implemented a digitalized platform for users to obtain
				expert knowledge of the local geography and culture with the ability to customize it according to
				the user’s requirements.<br />
				Main components of the system<br />
			<ul class="introP">
				<ol> Travel buddy suggestion system</ol>
				<ol>
					Predicting the best time to visit tourist attractions

				</ol>
				<ol>
					Identification and providing safety issues and relevant precautions to take.

				</ol>
				<ol>
					Traveler Feedback Analysis

				</ol>
			</ul>
			<p class="introP">Through the initial planning stage, the user will be suggesting a travel companion based
				on age and
				transportation medium. In the best visit time analyzer module, we have identified the best time to
				visit tourist attractions by analyzing real-time crowd data, weather conditions, and the positive
				ratings of the attraction. The safety analysis module will do Identification of safety ratings for
				the selected route through a weightage model and predict threatening areas using historical data
				analysis. In the user feedback analysis, the system analyzes the reviews, identifies the positivity
				and negativity of the feedback, and displays them in relevant places. Admin can review all the
				feedback through the dashboard and interact with the people who gave the feedback to improve the
				system.</p>
