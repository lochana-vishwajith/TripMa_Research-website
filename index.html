			<h2>Welcome to TripMa</h2>
			<p class="introP">
				Travel planning is a tedious task to engage from the perspective of travelers since it involves crucial
				and critical decision-making due to a lack of foreign geography and cultural knowledge. Initially, the
				concept of traveling through travel agencies was used and it was slowly diminishing due to the fact of
				freedom and exploration are too constant and bounded according to the organizer’s perspective. Through
				this intended product we are catering to the challenge of fulfilling the traveler’s local knowledge gap
				using the dynamic prediction and recommendation areas. The system has identified the importance of
				grouping or the sharing expectation of a traveler through mapping out the best matching companions along
				with identification of tourist attractions and the best time to visit those places, which also included
				safety precaution methodologies to the travelers, which provide them the capabilities of preparing and
				mitigating the potential risks along with the traveling areas. The inclusion of the user feedback
				analysis model will impact identifying the user’s perspective of the system and ensures users’ trust
				towards the system, The system has iteratively used location-based knowledge through third-party APIs
				such as GOOGLE MAP API. The below sections will describe and illustrate the modes of machine learning
				techniques used, weighted models, and the NLP data mining methodologies used to acquire the systems
				architecture.<br />
